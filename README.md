Summary

With Tag Along, I set out to build an app that allows friends/family to go on road trips. I was inspired by my mom and the love of road trips. Eventually, with time friends will scatter throughout the country. There were times, when my friend of I wanted to go on road trips but our overlapping schedules made things quite impossible. So I thought, why not build a website where you can post trips and friends, family, or mutual friends can tag along. So Login, Explore, and Road Trip!


Technology

Tag Along is a full-stack application incorporating Node.js and Express and using the MongoDB database. Front-end was built with Angular while the styling was accomplished with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

Biggest Challenge/Next Steps

My next steps for this project is eventually creating more groups. One of the reason why I wanted to create an app like this is for parents with children who are part of extracurricular groups that require a lot of travel. For that main reason, I would like to implement a password protected group that allows coaches, teachers, instructors to add the parents into the group. Essentially a safe trip for the kid! 

My biggest challenge during this project was user authentication and applying the authentication for login. I went the path of using jwt(Json Webtoken), this process allowed to firmly grasp how request and response work to connect Front-End(Angular) and Back-End(Express/Node/MongoDB). want to eventually incorporate a photo feed for each venue, by requesting additional data from the Foursquare API. We anticipate making this addition to our next iteration of Venture Us.
